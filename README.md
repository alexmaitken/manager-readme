# Alex Aitken's Manager Readme (WIP)

## About me

### General

Hey, I'm an engineering manager at Careem. I'm currently leading the Identity team. I am a new parent (since April 2019) and like to spend as much time as possible with my baby daughter. I keep myself fit with Freeletics and enjoy my coffees milky (in the morning). I keep a website: https://www.alexaitken.nz but it's not well maintained (so many ideas for topics, but not enough focus to finish them).

### History

I have been a tech lead, senior developer, and engineer in a variety of companies. You can see where I've worked on LinkedIn. Feel free to browse my profile.

### Why management?

I decided to change my career path from purely tech to management because the more senior roles I got in the technical domain, the more I liked to lead the team. You may think:
>but you can lead without being a manager, why management?
>
Part of the reason for me is because I saw an opportunity to lead without being centre of attention. I can coach, mentor, and guide people in the right direction. I get to talk with a variety of different people every day, and while that can be exhausting, it's also fun.

I've only been a manager for a short time, but I've learnt a lot. I find it an engaging career (so far) and have been able to weather the storms that have come my team's way.

## Contact

### Best way

The best way to contact me is in person. Following that, I'm usually available on Slack and will check emails occassionally (other than meeting invites).

### Office hours

Generally speaking, I work the team's office hours. Usually somewhere from 9am-6pm Mon-Fri.

### Outside of office hours

I tend to sometimes check in on slack (I know, it's bad) outside of office hours. However, I won't write to the team outside of office hours. I expect you to not follow my example here.


## Expectations

### Be present

You should be present and active during the team's agreed meetings (if we have them). That could mean, attending standup if you're remote, participating in retrospectives, or participating during refinements.

### Follow the team's processes

You may not agree with how the team works, but bring that up to the team. Don't just go your own way and do things the team wouldn't normally do.

### Friendly Debate

If you and another member disagree on approaches or technical topics, you shouldn't make it personal. If you cannot agree at all, let's talk about it.

### Express concerns

If you're concerns about the team or yourself, please bring it to me immediately. I'm here for your happiness.

### Be aware of the team's OKRs

You should know what the team's OKRs are and how your task aligns with them. If you're taking tasks that are irrelevant to the teams overall goals, you should be asking why you're doing it.

### Feedback

I'm continously learning as a manager. Please being your feedback to our 1:1s or give it to me when appropriate. Have I overstepped my authority? Am I not focusing enough on your development? Am I not giving you constructive feedback? I'm here to make the team a success and without this feedback loop I can't improve either.

## 1:1s

### What are these and why?

I like to have 1:1s with my team to coach them and help them see areas that they can focus on. My goal as your manager is to help you along in your career. 

### How I run 1:1s

If you're in my team, then you'll likely find that I have time for biweekly 1:1s. I tend to be proactive and set up the slots for you and will move them around if I can't make it or you can't. I keep a shared Google doc that you may edit at any point so you can prepare for the meeting/review after the meeting. 

I will have my laptop with me that's visible to both of us as I make notes or we look up/review something.

### Example of doc:

```17.05.2019

Discussion:
* Baby due in 3 weeks.
** Excited and nervous.
* Wants to be active in reviews more.

Actions:
* Joe to make at least 3 code reviews before next 1:1.
* Alex to make sure stand ups run regularly.

Feedback:
* Improve the agile processes in the team. No one taking ownership of meetings.
```

We will review the actions from the last 1:1 at the beginning of the next 1:1. We should make sure the goals/actions are **SMART** (Specific, measureable, assignable, realistic, and time-related/bound).
